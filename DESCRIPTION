Title: Sequential BART for Imputation of Missing Covariates
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Michael Daniels
Maintainer: Aarti Singh <mdstat2016@gmail.com>
Description: Implements the sequential BART (Bayesian Additive
     Regression Trees) approach to impute the missing covariates. The
     algorithm applies a Bayesian nonparametric approach on factored
     sets of sequential conditionals of the joint distribution of the
     covariates and the missingness and applying the Bayesian additive
     regression trees to model each of these univariate
     conditionals. Each conditional distribution is then sampled using
     MCMC algorithm. The published journal can be found at
     <https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxw009> Package provides a
     function, seqBART(), which computes and returns the imputed
     values.
